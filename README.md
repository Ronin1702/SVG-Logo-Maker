## Usage

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `{text}-{shape}-logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated {text}-{shape}-logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `{text}-{shape}-logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
```

## Tests
> **Reminder**: You must have ***Jest***, ***Mock-fs*** and ***Inquirer*** packages installed before running any tests. See [Installation](#installation).

* Each shape class could be tested for a `render()` method that returns a string for the corresponding SVG file with the given shape color.
* To run a specific test *e.g.* `shapes.test.js` from the `/test` folder, use the command below:
```bash
npm run test ./test/shapes.test.js
```
* To run all tests at once, use the command below:
```bash
npx jest
```
